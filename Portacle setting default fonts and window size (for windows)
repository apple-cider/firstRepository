;; to set default fonts for starting portacle, add the following line to the user.el file that can be found in the config directory under the portacle directory,
;; e.g C:\portacle\config\user.el

(add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(font . "Noto Mono-11")   ; note do not add a quote (') to the beginning of this line
;; DO NOT TYPE '(add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist .......) (see the quote before the parenthesis)
;;this example sets the font to Noto Mono size 11.  For reference, can go to options menu in emacs and look for details in "set default font" selection

;; Portacle saves the frame (emacs lingo) size when the session is quit.  The next time portacle starts up, it will start with the last frame size.
The above has been works for me.
